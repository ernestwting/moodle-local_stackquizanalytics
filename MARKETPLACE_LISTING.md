## Plugin name

STACK q-type Analytics

## Component / Frankenstyle name

`local_quizanalytics`

(Matches plugin id 3995 on the Marketplace — https://marketplace.moodle.com/plugins/3995
— the listing this replaces. That listing's own display title read
"STACK Analytics" as of the last time it was checked, not the current
"STACK q-type Analytics" above; worth reconciling manually when
submitting, since that's a listing-level field this doc can't confirm
gets overwritten by a version upload alone.)

## Short description (1–2 sentences)

Question-level, course-wide, and Analytics-API-backed analytics for STACK
(Maxima CAS) quizzes — statistics, solution-process visualizations, and
risk/review prediction models, computed directly from Moodle's own
database with no separate service to install.

## Long description

STACK q-type Analytics brings four sections of insight to STACK
(Maxima CAS) quizzes under one installable plugin, without any CSV
export/upload step or separate server to configure — everything reads
straight out of Moodle's own database and runs in-process, in plain PHP.

**Quiz Analytics** — course-wide view: compare every STACK quiz in a
course side by side (grade distributions, engagement over time, an
attempts-vs-grade scatter plot, trend lines).

**Question Analytics** — per quiz: difficulty and discrimination indices,
response outcome distribution, a student performance matrix, consolidated
question metrics, and a per-question error drill-down showing exactly what
each student submitted next to the correct answer. Also includes
**Solution Process Visualization**: class-wide answer transition graphs
showing how students moved through a question's Potential Response Tree,
per-node network centrality, 3D charts plotting each student's distance
from the correct answer across attempts, and a cross-attempt comparison
highlighting who improved, stayed flat, or regressed. PDF export on every
view in both of these sections, with section checkboxes, a colorblind
mode, and an anonymize-student-data toggle.

**Model Analytics** — built on Moodle's own Analytics API.
**Model 1 (Student risk)**: a target predicting whether a student is at
risk of not achieving course success, fed by five behavioral indicators
(grade trajectory, response-latency anomaly, disengagement entropy,
help-seeking gap, feedback-revision distance). **Model 2 (Question/PRT
review)**: a target predicting whether a STACK question's Potential
Response Tree needs instructor review, fed by four indicators (IRT-inspired
difficulty, syntax-error rate, unreached-node ratio, feedback-
ineffectiveness). Both models ship **disabled** by default — what this
section shows is each model's live indicator reading, not a trained
prediction, until an administrator reviews the thresholds and
enables/trains a model under Site Administration → Analytics → Models.

**Diagnostics Analytics** — seed-bias (one-way ANOVA) and PRT
branch-coverage reports, kept outside the ML pipeline since they have no
natural ground-truth label: direct calculations, not model predictions.
PDF export re-derives whichever sections are ticked, in both Model
Analytics and Diagnostics Analytics, as a landscape report.

One "Analytics" nav entry (reachable from a course's own navigation, and
from an "Analytics" link this plugin adds directly to each STACK quiz's
own settings menu) with a "Section:" switcher between all four sections at
the top of every page — previously two separate plugins, now one install.

No external services, subscriptions, or API keys of any kind — every
computation runs in-process in plain PHP, and nothing ever leaves the
Moodle server.

Requires `qtype_stack` (the STACK question type) to have anything to show.

## Release notes (v2.4.13)

Copy-paste source for the "Plugin versions" tab (Edit plugin page →
Versions) when uploading this release.

Readability and consistency pass, prompted by real user reports: a
multi-part STACK question's text and its Right Answer/error drill-down
values now render with a visible line break between parts/answers instead
of running together on one line, and orphaned `[[validation:...]]` markup
no longer leaks into the displayed question text. Course-wide charts now
plot quizzes left-to-right in the order they were actually taught (by quiz
open date, falling back to creation order) instead of alphabetically. Every
user-facing message was rewritten as plain sentences instead of
em-dash/semicolon run-ons. All four sections' PDF downloads now show a
"this may take a while for a large course" notice, and a course-wide line
chart wide enough to need it now prints on a landscape page instead of
shrinking its labels past legible. Every section's header now follows the
same selector order (Course, then Quiz, then View, then colorblind/
anonymize toggles), the same "Quiz:"/"Apply" labeling, and the same "may
take a while" loading notice — shown reliably regardless of cache state,
not just on a cold view, and now disappearing on its own once the real
results have finished rendering below it. Maturity is now Stable.

## Release notes (v2.3.0)

Copy-paste source for the "Plugin versions" tab (Edit plugin page →
Versions) when uploading this release.

Internal housekeeping release: no functional or UI changes. Aligns the
plugin's internal component identifier with this Marketplace listing so
future versions install as an update rather than a separate plugin.

## Release notes (v2.1.0)

Copy-paste source for the "Plugin versions" tab (Edit plugin page →
Versions) when uploading this release.

Split the plugin's two combined pages into four independently-reachable
sections: **Quiz Analytics** (course-wide comparison only) and **Question
Analytics** (the per-quiz drill-down, split out so picking a quiz doesn't
silently swap you into a different report), and **Model Analytics** (Model
1 + Model 2) and **Diagnostics Analytics** (the Diagnostics Dashboard,
split out since it's direct calculations, not a model). Each section gets
its own PDF export entry point. Also: side-by-side Course/quiz selectors,
a consistent "STACK Analytics" page heading across every section, and
visual quiz-grouping dividers in Model 2's table and the Diagnostics list.

## Release notes (v2.0.0)

Copy-paste source for the "Plugin versions" tab (Edit plugin page →
Versions) when uploading this release.

Post-merge polish, ahead of submission: wording fixes throughout (title
case on the view/quiz selectors, plain-sentence intro text with no dashes
or semicolons, American spelling), the Model & Diagnostics PDF export now
colors each cell to match the on-screen good/watch bands, descriptive
per-download PDF filenames (course, scope, date) across all four PDF
export entry points, and a new "Anonymize student data" toggle on the
Model 1 view (shared with Quiz Analytics's existing one) that replaces
student names with stable pseudonyms on-screen and in the PDF alike.

## Release notes (v1.0.0)

Copy-paste source for the "Plugin versions" tab (Edit plugin page →
Versions) when uploading this release.

Initial release, merging the previously-separate `local_quizanalytics` and
`local_stackanalytics` plugins into one. Everything runs as plain PHP
inside the plugin itself — no separate service to deploy, no external
dependency beyond PHP.

- **Quiz Analytics**: course-wide cross-quiz comparison, per-quiz Question
  Analytics (difficulty/discrimination, response distribution, error
  drill-down, student performance matrix, question metrics), and per-quiz
  Solution Process Visualization (PRT transition graphs, network
  centrality, 3D distance charts, cross-attempt comparison). PDF export
  with colorblind-mode and anonymize-student-data toggles.
- **Model & Diagnostics Analytics**: two Moodle Analytics API prediction
  models (Student risk, Question/PRT review) plus a non-ML Diagnostics
  Dashboard (seed-bias ANOVA, PRT branch coverage), ships with both models
  disabled pending administrator review. PDF export of whichever sections
  are selected.
- One course-level "Analytics" nav entry and per-quiz settings-menu link,
  with a "Section:" switcher between the two halves at the top of every
  page.
- Colorblind-safe chart palettes throughout Quiz Analytics.

## Suggested category

current Marketplace form)

## Maintainer

## Supported Moodle versions

`$plugin->requires` in `version.php` currently states Moodle 4.0.0 as the
floor; CI (`.github/workflows/moodle-ci.yml`) tests against MOODLE_405_STABLE
specifically across PHP 8.1/8.2/8.3 and both PostgreSQL and MariaDB — verify
that branch is still on Moodle's currently-maintained list at submission
time (see moodledev.io/general/releases) and adjust `requires`/this listing
if not.

## Dependencies

- `mod_quiz` (core) — this plugin reads finished quiz attempts through
  mod_quiz's own question engine.
- `qtype_stack` — required; this plugin exists specifically to analyze
  STACK/Maxima question responses and has nothing to show without it.
  Declared in `version.php`'s `$plugin->dependencies` (`ANY_VERSION`, no
  qtype_stack API added in a specific release is depended on).

## Repository

https://github.com/ernestwting/moodle-local_stackanalytics

<!-- TODO before submitting: this repo is currently named
     moodle-local_stackanalytics on GitHub (renamed once already this
     session), but the plugin's frankenstyle component is now
     local_quizanalytics (see CHANGELOG.md's rename entries) — they no
     longer match. Renaming the repo again to moodle-local_quizanalytics
     is blocked: that name is already taken by the original, separate
     standalone local_quizanalytics plugin's own repo
     (~/Desktop/moodle-local_quizanalytics on this machine). Resolve that
     collision first (e.g. archive/rename the old standalone repo, since
     this plugin replaces its Marketplace listing anyway) before renaming
     this one to match and updating this URL and the two below. -->

## Privacy

Implements `\core_privacy\local\metadata\null_provider` — this plugin
stores no personal data of its own; every section only reads data already
governed by mod_quiz/the question engine/gradelib/logstore_standard_log's
own privacy providers, and Quiz Analytics/Question Analytics's own MUC
caches are derived/disposable, not independent storage. See
`classes/privacy/provider.php`.
