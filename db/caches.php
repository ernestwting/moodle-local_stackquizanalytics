/**
 * MUC cache area definitions for the Quiz Analytics half of local_stackquizanalytics.
 *
 * Every area is keyed on a cheap SQL fingerprint of the underlying attempts
 * (see classes/quiz/cache_helper.php), not a fixed TTL alone: a cache entry
 * is only ever served when the fingerprint still matches the current DB
 * state, so new/regraded attempts are reflected immediately rather than
 * waiting out the TTL. The TTL here is only a backstop against unbounded
 * growth for quizzes that are no longer being actively looked at.
 *
 * simplekeys: every key this plugin builds is an md5() hex string (see
 * cache_helper.php), which satisfies MUC's simple-key charset.
 * simpledata: false, since every area stores a decoded JSON array (the
 * {summary, sections, ...} API response), not a scalar.
